.. _Getting Started:

======================================
Do I need an edX account?
======================================

You need to have an edX account before you can enroll in courses. You can sign
up for an edX account in the edX mobile app, or use a browser to go to the
`edx.org`_ website. When you create your account, you need to be connected to
the Internet.

======================================
How do I create an edX account?
======================================

When you open the edX mobile app, select **Sign up and start learning**. You
can create an edX account using your email address or your Facebook or Google
account. You also provide the following information.

* Your name.
* The username that will identify you to course teams and to other learners.
* A password.
* Your country or region.

After you create your account, you can find courses that interest you and
enroll in them.


===========================================
How do I create or edit my user profile?
===========================================

After you have created and activated your edX account, you can edit your user
profile. Your edX profile allows you to share information about yourself with
the edX community. Course teams and other learners in your courses can view
your profile when they select your linked username in forums. You can share
either a limited profile or a full profile.

Your profile always includes your username. A limited profile shares only your
username and an optional profile picture. A full profile includes biographical
information in addition to your username and profile image.

.. note:: If you are under 13 years of age, you can only share a limited
   profile, and you cannot share a profile picture.

To create or edit your profile details in the mobile app, select your username
or profile picture. Select **Edit** to edit your profile details. In your profile
details, select **Change** next to the camera icon to change your profile
picture.

If you are over 13 years of age, you can share more information about yourself
by changing your limited profile to a full profile. You can indicate your
primary language and location and, in the **About Me** section, you can add
additional details such as your learning goals and other interests. To share a
full profile, select **Full Profile**.

.. note:: You must specify your birth year before you can share a full
   profile. If you are under 13 years of age, you cannot create a full
   profile.


==================================================
How do I find courses to take?
==================================================

When you open the app and sign in to your edX account, you see a list of the
mobile-friendly courses that you are currently enrolled in. At the end of the
list, select **Find a Mobile-Friendly Course**.

You can also use the menu at the top of the page. Select **Find Courses**.
