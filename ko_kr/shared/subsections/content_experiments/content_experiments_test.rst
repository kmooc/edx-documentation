콘텐츠 실험 테스트하기
##########################################

강좌를 시작하기 전에 의도한 대로 콘텐츠가 집단에게 제시되는지 확인 하기 위해서 콘텐츠 실험을 테스트해야 한다.

When you view a unit that contains a content experiment in the LMS Staff view,
you can select one of the experiment groups from a drop-down list. The unit page
then shows the content as the selected group of students sees it.

For example, in the following page, Group 0 is selected, and the HTML component
and video that is part of Group 0 is displayed.

You can change the experiment group selection to view the content that a
different experiment group of students sees.

.. note::    The example course content in this chapter uses content experiment 
 terminology to make the functionality clear. Typically, you would not use
 terminology in course content that would make students aware of the
 experiment.
