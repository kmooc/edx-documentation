강좌 콘텐츠 시험해보기
###########################

교수자 및 강좌 운영팀은 개강 이후 강좌가 진행되는 동안, 추가할 콘텐츠를 적용했을 때의 결과를 시험해볼 수 있다. 

강좌를 만들 때, 학습자 입장에서 콘텐츠 이용이 편리하고 유익할 수 있도록 이 기능을 사용할 것을 권장한다.

콘텐츠를 시험해보는 방법으로, 


* `Preview Course Content`_ 또는,
* `View Your Live Course`_  를 할 수 있다.

.. 참고:: 콘텐츠 그룹을 만들어 특정 콘텐츠를 특정 학습자들만 볼 수 있게 하려면, :ref:`Preview Cohort Specific
  Courseware` 를 살펴보는 것이 좋다.

강좌 베타 테스트에 관해서는
:ref:`Beta_Testing` 에 안내되어 있다.

강좌 콘텐츠 미리보기
*************************

강좌 콘텐츠를 게시하기 전에, 이것이 학습자에게 어떻게 보이는지를 미리 볼 수 있다. 

이때, 강좌 운영팀만이 Studio에서 가장 최근에 만들어진 강좌 콘텐츠를 보게 된다.
:ref:`Draft
(Never Published)`, :ref:`Draft (Unpublished Changes)`, 또는 :ref:`Visible to
Staff Only` 상태의 학습활동 콘텐츠를 미리 보는 것이다.

예를 들어, :ref:`publish a unit<Publish a Unit>` 를 하는데, 이 학습활동에 동영상과 게시판이 포함되어 있는 경우

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-studio.png
 :alt: A unit in Studio with a video and discussion

학습자는 학습 관리 시스템에서 다음과 같이 콘텐츠를 보게 된다.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-lms.png
 :alt: A unit in the LMS with a video and discussion

이후 강좌 운영팀이 학습활동에 선다형 문제를 추가할 경우 다음과 같이 변경되지만,

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-studio-added-comp.png
 :alt: A unit in Studio with a video, problem, and discussion

이렇게 변경된 학습활동을 게시하지 않으면, 이것이 학습자에게 어떻게 보일지 강좌 운영팀이 미리 볼 수 있다.

 **변경사항 미리보기** 를 클릭하여, 이것이 적용될 학습활동을 다음과 같이 미리볼 수 있는 것이다. 

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-lms-added-comp.png
 :alt: A unit in the LMS with a video, problem, and discussion

이는 :ref:`publish the change<Publish a Unit>` 후, 학습자가 보게 될 화면이다. 

진행중인 강좌에서는, :ref:`publish the change<Publish a Unit>` 전까지는 학습자가 선다형 문제가 추가되기 전의 콘텐츠를 보게 될 것이다. 

한편, 콘텐츠 그룹을 만들 경우 특정 콘텐츠를 특정 학습자들만 볼 수 있게 할 수 있다. 이때 강좌가 어떻게 보이는지를 미리보는 방법은 :ref:`Preview Cohort Specific Courseware` 에 안내되어 있다.

.. 참고:: 
  **Preview Changes** in not available when the unit's state is :ref:`Published
  and Live`, because in this case the preview and live version are exactly the
  same. You can view the live course to see the published content.

 
.. _View Your Live Course:

******************************************
View Your Live Course
******************************************

When you are working in Studio, you can test your course by viewing it in the
LMS. In the LMS, you can see your course as a student sees it. You can see your
course in `Staff View`_ or `Student View`_. If you are using content groups to
designate specific content as visible only to particular content groups, you can
see your course as a content group would see it.

While you work in Studio, you can switch to your live course to see how your
course appears to students in two ways.

* From the outline page, click **View Live**.
   
  .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-outline-view-live.png
   :alt: View live button on the outline

* In a unit page, click **View Live Version**.
   
  .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-unit-view-live.png
   :alt: View Live Version button on the unit page

=================
Staff View
=================

You see the course in the **Staff View**.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Live_Course_Staff_View.png
 :alt: Image of the Courseware page in a live course with Staff View indicated
     at top right and a View Unit in Studio button
 
In **Staff View**:

* You see all units that are :ref:`Published and Live`. For units that are
  :ref:`Draft (Unpublished Changes)` or :ref:`Visible to Staff Only`, you
  see the last published version of the unit. You see these units
  regardless of the release dates of the containing section or subsection.

* You do not see units that are :ref:`Draft (Never Published)`. To
  see these units, you must use Preview mode as described in :ref:`Preview
  Course Content`.

* You can access the Instructor Dashboard, which has features and reports that
  help you :ref:`run your course<Running Your Course Index>`.

When you view your course in **Staff View**, you can execute tests to make sure
that your course works the way you intend. For example,  before the release
date of a subsection, members of the course team can work through the problems
to verify that the correct answer gets a green check for correct, and that any
answer other than the correct one gets a red X for incorrect.

============
Student View
============

When viewing your course in the LMS, you can use the **Student** view to see the
course with all course content that is intended for all students.

.. note:: If you have enabled your course for cohorts and have designated some
  content as visible only to certain content groups, you can select a content
  group from the **View Course As** drop down list to see the content exactly
  as a student in a cohort associated with that content group will see it. For
  details, see :ref:`Preview Cohort Specific Courseware`.

To switch to the **Student** view, click **View this course as** and select
**Student** from the drop down list.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/test-view-as-student.png  
   :alt: Image of the View Course As drop down list with Staff, Student, and named content group options

In **Student View**:

* You do not see sections or subsections that have not yet been released.

* If the section and subsection are released, you see units that are
  :ref:`Published and Live`. For units that are
  :ref:`Draft (Unpublished Changes)`, you see the last published version of the
  unit. 

* You do not see units that are :ref:`Draft (Never Published)` or
  :ref:`Visible to Staff Only`. To see these units, you must switch back to Instructor view or use Preview mode as described in :ref:`Preview Course Content`.

* You can access the Instructor Dashboard, which has features and reports that
  help you run your course.
