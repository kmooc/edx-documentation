강좌 베타 테스트하기
#############################

스튜디오에서 강좌가 만들 때, 강좌 운영팀은 강좌의 설계 진행을 평가하고, 작업을  테스트하여, 빠진 부분과 오류를 찾고, 학습자의 경험을 살펴보기 위해 **적용결과 보기** 를 선택할 수 있다. 강좌를 수강할 때의 전반적 경험에 관한 정보를 수집하기 위해, 강좌의 베타 테스트를 해볼 수 있다.

베타 테스트 과정
******************************************

베타 테스터를 하면서, 학습자의 강좌 참여 경험의 질적 향상을 위해 관련 정보를 수집한다. 베타 테스트 단계와 각 단계별 준비하면서 살펴볼 질문은 다음과 같다. 

#. **계획** : 테스트하는 목적이 무엇인가? 테스팅 일정은?

#. **모집**: 몇 명의 테스터가 필요한가? 테스터들이 어느 정도의 시간을 들여야 하는가? 언제 피드백을 완료해야 하는가?

#. **강좌 접근 권한 제공** : 테스터들이 즉각 전체 강좌에 접근할 수 있는지, 혹은 다른 시기에 주제나 소주제에 접근하게 할것인지? 일정에 영향을 미치는지?

#. **피드백 수합** : 테스터들이 피드백을 어떻게 제공하길 원하는지? 누가 얼마나 자주 피드백을 확인하는지?

#. **피드백  평가** : 피드백을 어떻게 평가하는가? 그 결과로 누가 변경여부를 결정하고 일정은 어떤가?

#. **마무리** : 테스터의 노력을 어떻게 인정할 것인가? 테스터의 노력의 결과에 대해 무엇을 공유할 것인지?

위의 질문에 정해진 답은 없으며, 강좌 준비과정에서 해볼 수 있는 베타테스딩의 역할을 참고하도록 하기 위해 제시한 것이다. 

.. _Qualities_Testers:

***************************************
베타 테스팅의 역할
***************************************

Beta testers have early access to the course. Beta testers are not members of
the course team or staff: they don't have information about "how it's supposed
to work". They use their own computers and Internet connections to view
videos, follow links, and complete problems. They interact with the course as
students will to find, and make, mistakes.

However, beta testers are not the same as other students in the course,
either. They have privileged access to the course and have more time to review
and complete the course materials than the enrolled students do. Course
discussions are not open before the course start date, so beta testers cannot
participate in community conversations. As a result of these differences, beta
testers do not receive certificates when they complete a course.

.. note:: If one of your beta testers wishes to earn a certificate for the 
 course, she must create a separate user account with a different username and
 email address. She can then use that separate, non-privileged user account to
 enroll in the course and repeat the work, completing assignments and exams
 when they are available to all students.

==================================
좋은 베타 테스터의 자질
==================================

A beta test is valuable in part because it is unscripted. Your beta testers are
not following a predetermined series of steps, or using a particular computer
environment, when they access your course. When you recruit beta testers,
however, you may find these skills and characteristics to be helpful.

* Curiosity.

* Attention to detail for identifying problems and inconsistencies.

* Solid communication skills for reporting problems to course staff. 

Your beta testers should also have varying levels of knowledge about the course
content:

* To recognize when material is wrong or missing, at least one tester should
  know the content well.

* To identify material that is unclear, at least one tester should be less
  familiar with the content.

Depending on the objectives you set for your beta test, you may want to consider
recruiting testers who use assistive technologies, who have different native
languages, or who have varying levels of familiarity with computer software.

=========================================
베타 테스터로 강좌 운영팀 활용하기
=========================================

Course staff can provide valuable feedback about your course. However, they are
typically stakeholders in the success of your course and have a significant
amount of knowledge about it. As a result, they can be too close to the course
to interact with it in the same way as students will. They can also be either
reluctant to provide feedback, or overly zealous.

If you do want a staff member to be a beta tester, a different, second email
address must be used for this additional role. The privileges of the course
staff role override those of a beta tester, so a second registration on the
site, activation, and enrollment in the course are necessary using this second
email address. The staff member must log in using the second email address (with
the beta tester role) in order to experience the course as a student.

.. _What_Test:

*********************************
테스트 항목
*********************************

Beta testers should interact with everything in the course. 

* Click all links.

* Watch all videos.

* Download video transcripts and other files.

* Complete all problems. 

As they work, beta testers log issues and questions for the course team.

.. note:: Beta testers cannot read or make discussion posts or contribute to 
 the course wiki.

.. _How_Testers_See_Course:

******************************************
베타 테스트 가능 시점
******************************************

To beta test a course, you: 

* Define a number of days before section and subsection release days for testing
  to begin.

* Identify beta testers.

Designated beta testers see course content before students can. The matrix
that follows shows the course content that beta testers can access earlier
than other students.

+-------------------------------------------+------+------+
|                                           | Yes  |  No  |
+===========================================+======+======+
| Before the Course Enrollment Date         |  X   |      |
+-------------------------------------------+------+------+
| Before the Course Start Date              |  X   |      |
+-------------------------------------------+------+------+
| Before the section Release Day            |  X   |      |
+-------------------------------------------+------+------+
| Before the subsection Release Day         |  X   |      |
+-------------------------------------------+------+------+
| Before the unit is Public                 |      |   X  |
+-------------------------------------------+------+------+
| Before a draft replaces a live unit       |      |   X  |
+-------------------------------------------+------+------+

The course team can continue to add content in Studio after the beta test
begins. When new content is ready for testing, be sure to :ref:`publish the
unit<Publish a Unit>`.

================================
베타테스트 시작 정하기 
================================

To define the start of the beta test, you use Studio to specify a number of days
before the release day that is defined for each section and subsection in your
course.

#. In Studio, from the **Settings** menu select **Advanced Settings**.

#. In the field for the **Days Early for Beta Users** policy key, enter the
   number of days before each section and subsection release day for beta
   testers to have access.

#. Click **Save Changes**.

.. Is this example helpful? how can we assess whether it is frightening/confusing to course team, or helpful?

Beta tester access to courseware for a course with **Days Early for Beta Users**
= 20 and 2 sections:

+-------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Course Enrollment Date = 31 August        | 31 August; earlier if enrolled by course staff |
+===========================================+================================================+
| Course Start Date = 15 September          | 26 August                                      |
+-------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| section 1 Release Day = 15 September      | 26 August                                      |
+-------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| section 2 Release Day = 22 September      | 2 September                                    |
+-------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| subsection 1 Release Day = 22 September   | 2 September                                    |
+-------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| subsection 2 Release Day = 24 September   | 4 September                                    |
+-------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| subsection 2, unit 1 Visibility = Public  | 4 September                                    |
+-------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| subsection 2, unit 2 Visibility = Public; | 4 September for Public version;                |
| draft in progress                         | No access to draft                             |
+-------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| subsection 2, unit 3 Visibility = Private | No access                                      |
+-------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+

In this example, the beta testers cannot access all of the courseware when the
beta test starts on 26 August: they can access section 1 but not section 2. You
may want to provide a schedule of section availability to your testers so that
they can plan their time appropriately. Future release dates do not display to
the beta testers in the courseware.

.. _Add_Testers:

*********************************
베타 테스터 추가하기
*********************************

Before you can add beta testers:

* You need the email address or username of each beta tester. 

* Each beta tester must register and activate a user account for that email
  address/username.

When you add beta testers, note the following. 

* If the beta test starts before the course **Enrollment Start Date**, testers
  cannot enroll themselves in your course. However, you can enroll the beta
  testers prior to the **Enrollment Start Date**.

* If you add the beta testers after the defined start of the beta test, and
  they are enrolled in the course, they see your course on their **Current
  Courses** dashboards when they log in.

* If you add beta testers before the test starts, or if they are not enrolled,
  they do not see your course on their dashboards. You can enroll the beta
  testers in the course yourself, and you may want to send an email message to
  remind them when the test begins.

.. _Add_Testers_Bulk:

================================
여러명의 베타 테스터 추가하기
================================

If you have a number of beta testers that you want to add, you can use the
"batch add" option to add them all at once, rather than individually. With this
feature, you have options to enroll the beta testers in the course (before or
after the **Enrollment Start Date**) and send an email message to notify the
beta testers that they have been added.

To add multiple beta testers:

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Click **Instructor**, and then click **Membership**. 

#. In the **Batch Beta Tester Addition** section of the page, enter one or more
   addresses or usernames separated by commas or line feeds (the Enter key). You
   can also copy data from a CSV file of email addresses and paste it here.
 
#. To enroll the beta testers in your course, leave **Auto Enroll** selected. If
   the beta test starts before the course **Enrollment Start Date**, testers
   cannot enroll themselves in your course.

#. To send an email message to the beta testers, leave **Notify users by email**
   selected. An example of the message that is sent to a beta tester who is not
   enrolled (or auto enrolled) in the course follows.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Beta_tester_email.png
  :alt: "You have been invited to be a beta tester for {course name} at {URL}. 
        Visit {link} to join the course and begin the beta test."

6. Click **Add beta testers**.

To remove the Beta Tester role from one or more users, enter their email
addresses in the **Batch Add Beta Testers** field and then click **Remove beta
testers**. 

.. note:: The **Auto Enroll** option has no effect when you click **Remove 
 beta testers**. The user's role as a beta tester is removed; course
 enrollment is not affected.

================================
개별 베타 테스터 추가하기
================================

To add a single beta tester:

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Click **Instructor** then **Membership**.

#. In the **Administration List Management** section, use the drop-down list to
   select **Beta Testers**.

#. Under the list of users who currently have that role, enter an email address
   or username and click **Add Beta Tester**. 

   If the beta test starts before the **Enrollment Start Date** of your course,
   you can also enroll the beta tester. See :ref:`Enrollment`.

To remove the Beta Tester role from users individually, find the user in the
list of beta testers, and then click **Revoke access** to the right of that
user's email address.

.. _Issue_Reporting_During_Course:

*********************************
문제점 보고하기
*********************************

Despite the efforts of the course team and the beta testers, additional
problems, questions, and issues can occur while a course is running.

* Often, students report issues by asking questions in a discussion. Your
  discussion administration team can watch for posts that indicate problems.

* To let students know the best way to report problems, you can post information
  on the **Course Info** page or post it in a discussion.

.. per Mark 19 Feb 14: eventually we want to provide more guidance for students:  course issues > use discussions, platform issues > submit issue to edx.
