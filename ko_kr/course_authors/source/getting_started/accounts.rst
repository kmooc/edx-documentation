.. _edX.org and edX Edge:

*************************
edX.org and edX Edge
*************************

When you want to explore edX courses, you can register on edX.org_, edX Edge_, or both. These sites are visually and functionally the same, but the content and purpose are different.

* edX.org_ hosts massive open online courses (MOOCs) from edX institutional partners. To publish courses on edX.org, you must have an agreement with edX and specific approval from your university. Courses on edX.org are publicly listed in the edX course catalog and are open to students from around the world.

* EdX Edge_ is edX's more private site. Courses on Edge are not published on edX.org. Any member of a partner course team can create and publish courses, including test courses, on Edge without receiving approval from edX or an affiliated university. However, Edge does not have a course catalog, and courses cannot be found through search engines such as Google. Only students whom you explicitly invite or who have the URL for your course can participate in your course on Edge.

* EdX Edge_ also hosts small private online courses (SPOCs).

.. note:: All course data and accounts on Edge_ and edX.org_ are separate. If you want to use both edX.org and Edge, you must go through the registration process on both sites.

*************************
Create an Account
*************************

To get started, you create, or *register*, an account on edX.org_ or Edge_.

   Account.**

   For Edge, go to the `registration page <https://edge.edx.org/register>`_.

#. In the registration form, enter your information in the fields that have
   an asterisk (*).

    field, not the name in the **Full name** field.

    If you are at an edX consortium university, you should use your institutional e-mail address.

3. For edx.org, select the **I agree to the edX Terms of Service
   and Honor Code** check box, and then click **Create your account**.

   For Edge, select both the **I agree to the Terms of Service** and **I agree
   to the Honor Code** check boxes, and then select **Create my Edge Account**.

#. In the activation e-mail message, click the link to complete the activation.
   When your account has been activated, a new window in your browser opens to
   an "Activation Complete" page that contains a link to your dashboard.

******************************
The edX Demo Course and edX101
******************************

EdX provides the `edX Demo course`_ and edX101_ to help familiarize you with
taking and creating edX courses.

* The `edX Demo course`_ allows new students to explore and learn how to take an
  edX course. We recommend that you become familiar with the way students
  experience an edX course before you begin building your first course.

.. note:: You can include information about the edX Demo course in your course
  materials, and recommend that new students take the edX Demo course before
  proceeding with your course.

* edX101_ is an example of a course built with Studio. It is a self-paced walk-through of planning, building, and running your own online course.
