사용자 인증 창이 나타날 것이다. 로그인 혹은 edX에 가입을 물을 것이다.
(이미 edX에 계정이 있다면, 로그인을 사용한다. 강좌에 등록되어 있어야 한다. 5단계로 건너뛴다. 
 그렇지 않다면 3단계로 간다.)

**Step 3: edX에 계정을 만든다**

Fill out the form in the pop-up window. (Some tips: Use an email address you
check regularly. Also, the username you choose will also be your screen name in
the course. This means the only name we will know you by is the username (not a
first and last name). Please include your last name as part of your username so
we can tell who you are in the course discussions.)


**Step 4: Activate your edX account**

Check your email. This is where your course activation link has been sent. You must click on this to finalize your access to the course.

Congratulations! You should now have an edX account and be enrolled in [ENTER
YOUR COURSE NUMBER].

Proceed with Step 5 to access the class materials.


**Step 5: Log in to edX and go the course website**

Log in to your account on edX at https://edge.edx.org/
by using the username and password you just created.
You will be taken to the main landing page of your edX edge account, which should now include a listing for [ENTER YOUR COURSE NUMBER]: [REPLACE WITH SCREENSHOT OF YOUR COURSE]

You can now click **View Courseware** to enter the main course website. 

If you are experiencing problems with enrollment or with accessing the class website, please contact [SUPPORT CONTACT NAME] at [CLASS SUPPORT EMAIL].
